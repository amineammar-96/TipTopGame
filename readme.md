# don't forget to add
## when i close a store i want to close users (Client , manager , employes)


# for client sign up
## if the firstTime to login after a sign it we be redirect to the page to select the store related to it 
## a client maybe can have many store but he must choose the favorite one to get the prize from it 


##add is_active to the user model to verify if the user account is active or not
and if he is registered with social media we set the is_active to true automatically and we don't need to verify the email
else if he is registered with email we set the is_active to false and we send him an email to verify his account
